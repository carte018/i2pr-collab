This is the official GIT repository for the i2pr-collab effort.  

Currently, there's very little here, other than this README file, but as time permits, 
Duke will attempt to release at least those parts of our exsiting OIM connector base 
that may be of interest and/or value, either to other OIM sites or to folks who aren't
using OIM but who may be looking to solve some of the same IDM data exchange issues we've
been confronted with.

It's an open collaborative site, so others are more than welcome to contribute, as well.  

Note that anything you share on this site will be world-readable, so if there's anything 
proprietary or otherwise sensitive that you'd like to share, you'll want to share it through 
another mechanism -- assume anything you post here is as public as public gets.

As things change and the site expands, I'll try to make updates to this README file and 
stay (at least roughly) in sync.
