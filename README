I've added the bulk of Duke-developed Oracle IDM code to the repository under the 
"duke/oracle_idm" tree.  A few caveats:

1. We've made a significant effort to remove any sensitive information from the code
  and replace it with placeholders, but given that there's some rather hastily-developed
  code in the tree, it's possible that we missed something.  Should you stumble upon anything
  that seems sensitive (and you're likely as good a judge of that as we are), please let 
  me know so we can expunge it.

2. This code is not being held up as a shining example of anything.  It's released into the 
  wild with no warranty of servicability, reliability, or applicability for any purpose.
  It is also released with no associated expectation of support.
  You're welcome to do anything with it that you feel is appropriate, including ignore it, 
  but realize that whatever you do with the code, you do entirely at your own risk. :-)

3. That said, this code *is* in production here at Duke, and *is* solving problems (and in 
  at least a few cases, causing others) for us.  More than likely, there's enough Duke-
  specific logic in the code that reusing it in its entirity anywhere else on this or another 
  planet won't be feasible, but modulo some possible minor adjustments for differing build 
  environments, provided all the prerequisite libraries are available, the code should all 
  build and may even execute in your environment.  If it doesn't, read paragraph 2, above. :-)

4. *That* said, if you run into questions about the code, etc., please feel free to contact me
  at <rob@duke.edu>.  I can't promise that I'll respond to all questions quickly, or that my 
  responses will necessarily be what you're hoping for, but I'll at least try to help the code
  make as much sense to you as it does to us here at Duke.

========================
5.2.2011

This is the official GIT repository for the i2pr-collab effort.  

Currently, there's very little here, other than this README file, but as time permits, 
Duke will attempt to release at least those parts of our exsiting OIM connector base 
that may be of interest and/or value, either to other OIM sites or to folks who aren't
using OIM but who may be looking to solve some of the same IDM data exchange issues we've
been confronted with.

It's an open collaborative site, so others are more than welcome to contribute, as well.  

Note that anything you share on this site will be world-readable, so if there's anything 
proprietary or otherwise sensitive that you'd like to share, you'll want to share it through 
another mechanism -- assume anything you post here is as public as public gets.

As things change and the site expands, I'll try to make updates to this README file and 
stay (at least roughly) in sync.
